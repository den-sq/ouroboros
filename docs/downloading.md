# Download and Install Ouroboros

There are prebuilt applications available in [Releases](https://github.com/We-Gold/ouroboros/releases).

- Windows: `*-setup.exe`
- Mac: `*.dmg`
- Linux: Multiple options available

When you open the app, the GUI will open immediately, but **the local server that runs the processing could take up to 15 seconds to start**. There is an indicator in the GUI that shows if the server is connected.

Currently, none of the apps are notarized. 

For Mac, if an error occurs when you try to run the app, find the app installation (should be called `ouroboros.app`) and run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ouroboros.app`.
